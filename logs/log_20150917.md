Learn build process numpy

###1. First step numpy is trying to use Cython to compile the Python extension module.

Log;

numpy/random/mtrand/mtrand.pyx has not changed

Cythonizing sources

#### Knowledge I got:

And I found there are only three pyx

./numpy/distutils/tests/pyrex_ext/primes.pyx

./numpy/random/mtrand/mtrand.pyx

./tools/allocation_tracking/alloc_hook.pyx

But only mtrand.pyx it built to numpy product.

More clear on ALTAS, BLAS, LAPACK.

Fortran is compilation language. But the generated fortran lib is not compatible with C and C++.

Fortran: http://www.tuicool.com/articles/bANZjy

Fortran 1954   

C: 1972

Need some knowledge on Python's distutil: https://docs.python.org/2/distutils/ to understand the numpy build process.

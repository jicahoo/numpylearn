Learn build process numpy

###1. First step numpy is trying to use Cython to compile the Python extension module.

Log;

numpy/random/mtrand/mtrand.pyx has not changed

Cythonizing sources

#### Knowledge I got:

And I found there are only three pyx

./numpy/distutils/tests/pyrex_ext/primes.pyx

./numpy/random/mtrand/mtrand.pyx

./tools/allocation_tracking/alloc_hook.pyx

But only mtrand.pyx it built to numpy product.

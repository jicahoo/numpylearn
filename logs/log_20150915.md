Today I am trying to build numpy, following instructions from https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/INSTALL.txt
I am trying to run "python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu" successfully.
Firstly, I got error: raise RuntimeError("Running cythonize failed!"), which indicates that I need Cython. It happens that I have a docker image folsomlabs/cython-scipy. So I try to run it in that docker image;
Then, I got below error:
    numpy.distutils.fcompiler.CompilerNotFound: gnu: f90 nor f77

So I use apt to search and install the gfortran in that docker image:
    apt-get install gfortran
    root@7b45e138c19e:/home/produser/numpy# apt-get install gfortran
        ....
        update-alternatives: using /usr/bin/gfortran to provide /usr/bin/f95 (f95) in auto mode   --> It seems that I installed the wrong version.

In INSTALL.txt, I got , so I tried to build numpy on f95
    To build with gfortran:
        python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95


Finally, I ran command "python setup.py build --fcompiler=gnu95" successfully.
